### Description
This app helps people safely share content on social media by scrambling portion of the text that they don't want others to read/see. A user will write/paste the content and then specify the words they need to be scrambled (using another field), after which they specify a character to replace scrambled text with. 

Note: The user is allowed to specify more than one word (seperated by space) to be scrambled. 

The app also calculates the time taken to complete the operation.

### Technologies

* JavaScript ES6

### Setup
